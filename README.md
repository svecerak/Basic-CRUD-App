# Basic-CRUD-App

Basic CRUD implementation in PHP and MySQL. I wanted to focus on learning best security practises when it comes to preventing against SQL injection by making use of prepared statements, validating, sanitizing, and escaping user input.

Learned how to provision a remote SQL databse, and deploy the application through Heroku.
